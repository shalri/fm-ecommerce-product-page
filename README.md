## My process

### Built with

- NextJS
- React
- Tailwind
- Framer
- Prettier Tailwind Plugin
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I used NextJS for this challenge. Since I plan to integrate Frontend Mentor
into my study routine, I might as well play around with NextJS and React alongside the
challenges.

Implementing this challenge with NextJS made it more interesting. It gave me
a broader scope for learning.

This challenge proved to be more challenging than expected. Maintaining `state`
across components required for custom `hooks` and `useContext`.

I also sprinkled some Framer animations for UX/UI enhancements. Particularly
proud of the real time animation on the car notification when updating the
quantity of the items.

The light box implementation also leaves room for improvement. I'll refactor
this when I have time.

This challenge also showed the importance of a `.fig` file. I spent most of the time
pixel-pushing to set the dimensions, spacing, and layout just right. I am proud of the results since I was only eyeballing it.

### Continued development

I look forward to doing more challenges from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I like learning and practicing new concepts.
